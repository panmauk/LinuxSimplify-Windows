LinuxSimplify - Windows
A simple app that helps you switch from Windows to GNU/Linux.
It scans your hardware, recommends a distro that fits your system, downloads it, and flashes it to a USB drive — all in one flow.
How it works:

Slide to scan your hardware
Pick a distro (the app recommends the best ones for your system)
Download the ISO (automatically finds the latest version)
Flash it to a USB drive
Boot from USB and install

Features:

Detects CPU, RAM, GPU, storage, and boot mode
Filters out incompatible distros, recommends the best fit
Auto-resolves the latest download links so they never go stale
Verifies downloads with SHA256 checksums
Raw USB flashing (like dd/Rufus)
Auto-detects USB drives when plugged in
Cleans up ISOs after flashing

Supported distros: Ubuntu, Fedora, Linux Mint, Debian, Arch Linux, EndeavourOS, Pop!_OS, Lubuntu, Zorin OS, Trisquel

Requirements: Windows 10/11, admin rights for USB flashing
License: GNU GPL v3
